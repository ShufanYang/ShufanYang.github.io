The politics of interpretation emerges as a philosophy through attempts to examine what is and to what extent politics and power relations play a role in shaping, producing, and erasing meanings, as well as the context of interpreting texts, cultures, and lived experiences. Therefore, the question to keep in mind throughout this video is to what extent do power relations and political ideologies affect our interpretation and understanding? Within the political question, there are two perspectives: the political and the apolitical. The apolitical perspective follows the view that all interpretations are removed from political influence and that it is possible to have an entirely objective interpretation of anything. It is the belief that what is interpreted, and what language captures, can and must have entirely definite and universal meaning, and it is down to the interpreter to endeavor to apprehend. Therefore, they believe that our own choice to interpret a text or event from our own personal and often political point of view does not count towards meaningful interpretation. The goal of interpretation for them is to get the exact meaning that is inherent in what is being interpreted, and there is a fundamental idea that interpreting is the process between interpreter and the interpreted. Nietzsche argues that interpretation is conceived as an individual subject-object activity, rather than a collection of activities that come together like in politics. The political perspective, on the other hand, argues that interpretation is always politically defined. Whatever and however we interpret is more often than not determined by political preferences with its inherent power relations and ideology. What is being interpreted also emerges from a political point of view. Therefore, nothing we interpret can be devoid of political preference as well. The political perspective shows that there is a strong relationship between interpretation, language use, power, and ideology. Luca, on one hand, argues that discourse is produced by the effect of power. So let’s put this in context. In America, the Second Amendment of the Constitution, the right to bear arms, is being drawn into significant debate, with both sides interpreting the Constitution and the amendment itself in different ways. One argument that could be classified under the apolitical understanding would be that the meaning and the content of the Constitution is set, as we intended, to apply to all Americans throughout time. That no matter what the situation was, the Constitution, and thus here Second Amendment, could be applied in an objective manner. Others include legal interpretations of ideas like freedom, which some would argue have become so entrenched that they no longer have different interpretations, nor that they have any political connotations. The historical context in which it was also written remains devoid of any political context, and the adaptation of technology would also provide a different understanding of the Second Amendment. These understandings may fall on either side of the debate, but they all argue that they are not swayed by specific political ideologies of interest, as they require balanced approaches that take various factors into account. Each argument interprets the amendment at its base as objective in meaning. On the other hand, there are a number of political interpretations of the Second Amendment also, both falling on either side of the debate. For example, the conservative argument on one hand argues that the amendment is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution, and any attempt to change it would only promote government tyranny. On the other hand, progressives would argue for stricter gun control measures that the Second Amendment, and thereby the Constitution, should be subject to reasonable regulation to address contemporary societal changes. The political perspective of understanding here would argue that even those debates that are classed as apolitical are still influenced by political ideology. Or the apolitical perspective would argue that ideology and politics are shaped by objective facts and understandings that can be removed to be their own thing. So let’s return to the original question: To what extent do power relations and political ideologies affect our interpretation and understanding? We may have come up with your own different opinions based on what you’ve seen in this video. There is no denying that politics plays a hugely important role in real-life situations, regardless of whether or not you can separate out the objective truth.","link":"/2024/03/29/Amendment/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Gadamer, Politiics","slug":"Gadamer-Politiics","link":"/tags/Gadamer-Politiics/"},{"name":"TheUS, PoliticalPhilosophy","slug":"TheUS-PoliticalPhilosophy","link":"/tags/TheUS-PoliticalPhilosophy/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Hermeneutics","slug":"Hermeneutics","link":"/categories/Hermeneutics/"}],"pages":[]}
